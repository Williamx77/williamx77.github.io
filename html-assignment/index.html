        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student at algonquin college. I am currently enrolled in <em>Interactive Media design.
            I'm really enjoying the class so far and i'm excited to make my own personal website one day. 
            I was raised on the internet, and always wondered how websites were made. It's honestly really weird finally being able to understand
            how they are made, or atleast the basics of how they are.
        </em>
        </p>
        <p>I love to play games competitivly. I used to be top 10 in ontario in "ssbm" -super smash brothers melee-. this is my 1<sup>st</sup>year at algonquin. I have a twin brother who is currenlty enrolled in carelton university.
            I run a social media page that im trying to grow in my free time. Lastly I have a twin brother, although we are not identicle, we certainly look alike
            but you tell me.
